# TV listings app
for Hackbright final project

"TV...or Not TV" is a utility app that creates personalized TV listings based on a user's preferences and favorites. After selecting a TV service provider, users build a list of "favorite" shows which are organized into a listings schedule. The personalized schedule provides information on upcoming episodes including a synopsis, when to watch, channel information and if the episodes are new or in HD. Users can sign up to receive a text message notification to alert them when one of their favorites has a new episode that night.
